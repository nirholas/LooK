# APK Files Directory

Place your Android APK files here for recording demos.

## Usage

```bash
# Start the mobile Docker environment
look mobile-start

# Record a demo with an APK in this directory
look mobile ./docker/apks/your-app.apk
```

## Notes

- APK files in this directory are automatically mounted into the Docker container
- Files are mounted read-only for security
- The container will install the APK automatically when you run `look mobile`
